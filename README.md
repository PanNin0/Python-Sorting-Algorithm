# Python-Sorting-Algorithm-v1.0

This program is meant to be an easily modifiable sorting algorithm written and ran entirely within Python. If you're just looking to play around with the pre built algorithms then all explanations for how to use the program can be found in the "settings.py" file. Just change the variables in there according to the instructions and everything should work perfectly.

Note for people looking to add their own algorithms!!!
In its current state it may be a little hard to read through the code but work is being done to clean it up.
